### November

Have CCT set date for business meeting and then announce it at least two Sundays prior to meeting date.  By November CCT meeting make sure to have ascertained whether each CCT member wishes to continue on for another year. Also ascertain which CCT members are up for renewal of their third year (optional) term and if they are willing to serve the additional term.  Determine if an information meeting is needed prior to business meeting and then announce and plan accordingly.

### December Preparation

Make sure the proposed new year's budget is printed and available to the congregation for review at the beginning of December. Prepare written ballots for elections of the following annually re-elected positions:

1. Lay Moderator
2. Clerk
3. Treasurer 
4. Financial Secretary
5. New CCT Members
6. CCT Members that are being reelected for a third optional term

Also include on the ballot approval of the proposed year's budget and any other issues that are to be voted upon.

### Meeting

We have found that it is best to hold the meeting in the Lower Auditorium in between 1st and 2nd service for that half hour time slot, so that people will show up.  Make sure a quorum is present prior to starting the meeting.  Use the microphone when speaking. Hold the meeting in accordance to the Revised Robert's Rules of Order, allowing for orderly discussion of issues as needed. 

### Follow Up

Announce results in a timely manner.
