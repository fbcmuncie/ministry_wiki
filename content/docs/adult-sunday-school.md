At the beginning of your tenure as an Adult CCT representative, it's helpful to check in with each of the adult Sunday school classes and introduce yourself:

**First Hour**: Class meets in the Bride's Room on the lower level. The best contact for this class is James Heimlich.

**Second Hour**: The Intergenerational Class meets in the library on the top floor. The best contact for this class is Dana Davis. The Bykota/Friendship Class meets in the room closest to the ladies' room on the top floor. The best contact for this class is Jane Patton.

Besides introducing yourself at the beginning of your term, it's helpful to stop by each class at the beginning of their meeting time about once every six months. This helps members feel greater connection to you and provides an opportunity for you to become aware of issues the classes may be facing.
