The youth ski trip is an annual trip that takes place over MLK weekend in January. Registration begins in November. 

In the past, we have used the Registration module in Planning Center to facilitate registration.

Steps involved:

1. Set up Registration for ski trip in planning center (cost, medical release forms can be added to event)
2. Write article for bulletin and newsletter to advertise registration
3. Email past participants with link to registration (deadline for registration is usually December 1)
4. Once the participants have registered, we email the name, t-shirt size and gender of each participant to Laura Rollet, event registrar
5. Request deposit check from Ella Mae to be sent to Laura
6. Call Enterprise Van Rental to reserve transportation
7. Reminder around the first week of January to download and fill out release forms along with date, time and place information about departure and return (sample email below)
8. Purchase snacks for trip (water and select snacks for travel)
9. Pick up van rental and drive to Green Lake
10. Upon return, request check from Ella Mae with remaining balance

>Hello everyone, I'm so glad that you are attending the ski trip this year. I wanted to touch base with you about a few items before we leave town on the (date)

>First of all I wanted to cover when we are leaving and when we will return. We will leave from our house at noon on Friday (date). Please arrive by 11:30AM so we will have time to load the van and have a prayer before we leave. We will return sometime in the evening on Monday (date). We will notify parents via text message about an hour before we arrive. In the past, it has been around 6 or 7 PM.

>Secondly, the question is often ask about how much money you need to bring with you on the trip. I would suggest around $50 or so. You'll need to cover a meal on the way to Green Lake on Friday evening. Also, you'll need to cover a meal at the ski slope on Saturday. We will not be eating until late on Sunday evening. Many want to eat at the ski slope on Sunday. Finally, you'll need to cover one more meal on the way home.

>You may want to bring snacks for the road trip and downtime at Green Lake. We will provide waters and some snacks, but you might bring a few of your favorites.

>It is suggested that you bring a small duffel bag to transport clothes to the ski slope. We will rent lockers, but having a small bag for a change of clothes will be helpful. Also, you will want to remember to bring ski clothes, goggles, gloves, etc.

>Please be aware that there will be worship sessions on Friday evening, Saturday evening, and Sunday morning. Attendance will be required.

>Finally, you will need to bring the following forms with you on Friday. I will send all forms in a separate email Medical Release Form, Cascade Release Form, Devil's Head Release Form.

>Please let us know if you have any questions. My cell is (cell number).
