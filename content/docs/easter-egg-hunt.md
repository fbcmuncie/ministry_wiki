Set a date for the annual Easter egg hunt and get it on the church calendar.  Have a back-up plan (i.e. using the church) in case of bad weather the day of the hunt

Write an article for the Visitor about the Easter egg hunt in April.  Also, write an article for the bulletin asking for candy donations for the egg hunt.  Ask that all candy be individually wrapped.

Fill eggs for the Easter egg hunt.  There are two large trash bags full of plastic eggs in the downstairs storage room.

In the past, donuts, juice, and coffee has been served during the Easter egg hunt.
