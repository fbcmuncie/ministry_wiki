1. Determine date for lunch at least four weeks in advance. Check church calendar to make sure there are no conflicts. Add event to church calendar.

2. Contact restaurant where the lunch is to be held. Reserve room space, find out maximum capacity of space, and ask how far in advance they need to have a final number confirmed (often not necessary).

3. Set up registration through Planning Center Registrations, indicating the cap for the number of people and the deadline for registration. Make sure person checking registrations has been given admin access to event. If paper registration is also taking place, set up clipboard in the church office that clearly states the number of people who can sign up and the deadline for registration. Check registration numbers every 3-4 days.

4. Announce event in Sunday morning services, in the bulletin, and in the Visitor.

5. Plan a brief (ten minutes or less) activity that can be used for people to get to know one another better. Prepare any materials needed for this activity.

6. On the date of the lunch, arrive at the venue thirty minutes before the first guests are expected to arrive. Check in to the room and rearrange seating to best serve those attending. Check in guests as they arrive.

7. As soon as most people have arrived, begin the activity intended to help guests get to know one another. Ideally this should be complete before they begin eating.
