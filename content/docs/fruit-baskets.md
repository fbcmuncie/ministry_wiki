Baskets are assembled and delivered on the first Saturday in November.

Have Wade put that date on the church calendar (the first Saturday in November)

Buy baskets with handles starting in September or earlier. Goodwill and Attic Window always have a nice selection. Wash and spray with disinfecting spray and give time for them to dry out thoroughly.

Get a count of the number of shut-ins. Also, the church gives baskets to Wade, Clifton, Bruce, Nancy and any mentees’ we have.

Place an article in both the Visitor and the weekly bulletin to get volunteers to donate baked mini pumpkin loafs, mini pies and spiced nuts, and also to assemble and deliver baskets.

Look for a Bible verse relating to thankfulness from First Baptist Church type and print out, insert one into each basket.

Ask Children’s church coordinator to have children make thanksgiving pictures to put in each basket. Do this the first Sunday in October so you can have them back in time. Also, you can add paper fall leaves, ribbon, bows, etc. to make the baskets festive. Sue Mutter, Sally Jones and Gayle Songer to name just a few have helped in the past and are very talented at this making the baskets beautiful.

Run copies of each shut-ins, name and address, cut apart so that they can be put on the individual’s basket. We put Wade, Clifton, Bruce and Nancy’s in the church office, mentees’ in the room they are teaching in. That way they can take them home after Sunday Service.

The week before assembly and delivery call and remind all volunteers of date and time.

The day before delivery call all shut-ins, except in Nursing homes to see if someone will be home to receive the basket.

Appoint a volunteer to purchase fruit. Also, you will need clear plastic bags to put each basket in. Usually bought at Dollar Tree.

Each basket gets the following items:

1 red apple

1/2  lb. white grapes

1 green apple

1/2  lb. red grapes

2 bananas

1 mini pumpkin bread or mini pie

1 orange

1 bag of spiced nuts


Wash and dry all fruit before assembling.

Put double these amounts in Wade, Clifton and Bruce’s baskets, as they have families.

Clean kitchen and all utensils when finished.

Do not prepare baskets for people who live out of town.
