Each year, we recognize graduates in our congregation. These can be either high school or college graduates.

- Send out an email to solicit information about those who are graduating this year
- Schedule graduation recognition Sunday (with Clif or Wade)
- Purchase gifts to hand out to graduates. We sometimes do gift cards or books (around \$25 per graduate)
- Contact graduates to let them know about the recognition in worship
