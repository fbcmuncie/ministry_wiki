#### Card Ministry for shut-ins, ill and servicemen

Thank you for your willingness to serve our church in this ministry. I will have a copy of this list in the church office. The person working the desk is responsible for calling the volunteer for the month in case of hospitalizations, or a death so that the appropriate card can be sent. Also, if you know a need, please call the person who responsible of the card sending for that month. If for some reason you are unable to fulfill your commitment, please call Barbara Campbell 765-722-0703.
