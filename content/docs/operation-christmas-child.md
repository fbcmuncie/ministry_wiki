## September

Write an article for the October Visitor about Operation Christmas Child shoe boxes.  An article can also go in the bulletin asking for donations.  Jane Patton and Colleen Massoth are the contact people for this event.

## November

Plan a Sunday to fill shoeboxes for Operation Christmas Child.  Children in pre-school to 5th grade fill the boxes during Sunday School and Children’s Church.  It’s extremely helpful if the shoeboxes are already made before they get filled (they come in a large flat stack of boxes).  This is a huge time saver.
