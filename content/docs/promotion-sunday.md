Start planning for Promotion Sunday which takes place at the beginning of September.  Get a list of children who are promoting from the toddler class to the pre-school class, from the pre-school class to kindergarten, and from 5th grade to the youth department.  Each child getting promoted receives a gift from the church (usually between $10-$20 depending on how many children are being promoted).
