Each year, the American Baptist Churches of Indiana and Kentucky ask us to fill out an annual report. We will need to gather the following information for the church clerk to fill out this report after the first of the year. 

## Reflection Questions

As we reflect on all that God has been doing this year through First Baptist Church Muncie, we might take time in the December or January CCT Meeting to discuss the following questions.

1. What event most excited you last year? Why?
2. How did you reach out into your community in a new way? What happened?
3. What new thing did you try in mission or ministry? What did you learn?
4. What challenge did your church face? How is God bringing you through it?

## Church Membership

We do not typically keep up with inactive memberships. We can simply fill in the total active members by looking at the graph on the homepage of the people module. 

A report has been created in the church database for new members. The clerk will need to change the dates and refresh the report for new members in a given year. With the help of the pastor and deacons, the clerk should be able to determine which of these new members were baptized.

A report has been created in the church database for deaths. The clerk will need to change the dates and refresh the report for deaths in a given year. 

## Attendance Numbers

The pastor can provide worship gathering numbers for the year. We do not generally keep numbers in other ministries such as Sunday school or children's programs.

## Finances

After the first of the year, the Treasurer will need to provide the Church Clerk the following numbers:

- Total Church Income for the calendar year
- Total Church Expenditures for the calendar year
- Total non-ABC Missions for the calendar year

## Church Leaders

The clerk will need to update any information about new staff members and CCT members for the annual report. The clerk may simply print off a CCT contact sheet from the monthly minutes.
