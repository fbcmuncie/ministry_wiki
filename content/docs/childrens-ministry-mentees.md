## April

Start planning the summer schedule as the college mentees are usually gone for summer break at the beginning of May.  Decide if volunteers will be asked to cover classes or if K-5 will stay in the church service with their parents.  If K-5 stays in the church service over the summer break, they each get a mailbox in the back of the sanctuary with individual crafts and bible activities.  (Mentees are normally gone from May to August.)

## June

Confirm mentees for the Fall semester.  If a mentee graduated in the Spring and will not be teaching in the Fall, a new mentee will need to be secured before classes start in September.  Meet with the mentees to discuss schedules and getting specific dates they will each be available to start teaching again.
