Joint planning with Children and Worship

Determine who will order carnations from Misty’s Flower Shop for the children to pass out on Mother’s Day.  In the past, Julie Kirklin or the Worship Coordinator has ordered the carnations.

Communicate with the Worship pastor about when during the worship portion of the service flowers will be passed out on Mother’s Day

The day before Mother’s Day, pick up flowers from Misty’s Flower Shop.  They can be stored in one of the large refrigerators in the kitchen downstairs.

Help with the Mother’s Day service.  Children from pre-school to 5th grade participate in passing out flowers to women at the beginning of first and second service.
