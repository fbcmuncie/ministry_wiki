Decorations need to be up before the first Sunday of Advent, maybe right after 
Thanksgiving. Through this time, we do not take down decorations for weddings, 
etc.

Need to pick a decorating day and gather 4-5 people for help moving Christmas tree up from storage. Location is back of decorations room in back of the downstairs kids’ classroom. 

All the decorations are in storage room located upstairs by organ pipes and sound board. You will need a key to get into this room.  

Removal of decorations if possible, should be done 1st or 2nd week in January.
Poinsettias should be ordered around 4 weeks before Christmas.

Call for best prices…historically called G&M Nursery. They priced out at $10 for a 6” red poinsettia with foil wrapper. Make an order for 20 (this may Change) and confirm a delivery date. Saturday before Christmas is good idea.

3 weeks before Christmas, put a notice in bulletin with price and due date, with orders due 1 week before Christmas.

Congregation orders them in memory/honor of someone. Keep these orders- the names and the messages will be put in the bulletin later.

One week before call the business to confirm number of flowers, date of delivery and cost.

Request a check from church for total price.

Send all names and messages of the orders to Wade for the bulletin, making sure there is enough time to put it in the current(newest) bulletin. 

Someone needs to be at church to accept the poinsettias, pay for them and set up the stage.
